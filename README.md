# STUDENT-REGISTER
This Java Swing program creates a **Student Registration Form** with fields for name, gender, course, and address. Users can submit to view details in a dialog or clear the form. It uses `JTextField`, `JRadioButton`, `JComboBox`, `JTextArea`, and `JButton` with `ActionListener` for interaction.
